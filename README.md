2. Download the docker-compose-file (https://github.com/xtramarcf/backend_assets/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yaml).
3. Replace the POSTGRES_PASSWORD and the SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD with your own safe password.
4. Set a new Admin Password. You can log in to the Admin-Account with the user "Admin" and your set password.
5. Change the volume-directory at services.database.volumes to the directory, where the backups will be stored. Leave the part ":/var/backups/" untouched.
6. Run the start_app.bat command f√ºr Windows. For Linux, you can run "docker-compose up -d" and then, after 15 seconds, run "docker exec database cron".
7. The application is now accessible under "localhost:4200".
